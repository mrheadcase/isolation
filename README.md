## 🎯 How to Play

### **Basic Rules**
1. **Objective**: Be the last player who can make a move
2. **Movement**: Click any highlighted square adjacent to your piece to move there
3. **Removal**: After moving, click any square marked with × to remove it

5. **Victory**: Win when your opponent has no legal moves

### **Strategy Tips**
- **Control the Center**: Maintain mobility by staying near the board center
